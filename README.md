Project Title: Movie Review Service

Project Summary:The Movie Review Service is a backend application built using Spring Boot, which acts as a bridge between a user interface (UI) component and a MongoDB database. This project provides a simple and easy-to-understand way to manage and retrieve movie information and reviews.

Key Features:

  Get Movie Details: This service allows users to retrieve detailed information about a specific movie. Users can provide the movie's title or other relevant details, and the service     will return information such as the movie's title, release date, genre, and more.

  List All Movies: Users can request a list of all movies present in the database. This feature is useful for browsing through the entire movie collection.

  Write a Movie Review: Users can submit reviews for their favorite movies. They can provide a review title, text, and a rating. These reviews are stored in the database and can be       retrieved later.

How it Works:The Movie Review Service uses a MongoDB database to store movie information and user reviews. It employs Spring Data MongoDB repositories to interact with the database. Here's a simplified breakdown of how it works:

  Getting Movie Details: When a user requests information about a specific movie, the service queries the database using the provided movie title or other details. It then returns the    relevant information to the user.

  Listing All Movies: To retrieve a list of all movies, the service queries the database to fetch all available movie records and presents them in a user-friendly format.

  Writing a Movie Review: When a user submits a review, the service stores the review details (title, text, rating) in the database, associating it with the corresponding movie. This     allows users to view and access their reviews later.

Who Can Use This Project:This project is designed for anyone who wants to create a simple movie review system, whether it's for personal use or as part of a larger application. It's especially useful for developers who want to learn how to build a RESTful API using Spring Boot and integrate it with a MongoDB database.

Ease of Use:The Movie Review Service is designed to be user-friendly, and even someone with basic knowledge of movies and reviews can interact with it easily. The RESTful API endpoints are straightforward, making it accessible to both developers and non-developers.

In summary, the Movie Review Service is a beginner-friendly Spring Boot project that connects to a MongoDB database, providing essential functionality to interact with movie data and reviews through RESTful APIs. Whether you're a developer looking to learn or a movie enthusiast, this project can be a valuable addition to your application portfolio.
